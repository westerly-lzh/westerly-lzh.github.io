              <p>The rapid digitalization of our world has lead to exponential growth in business data and content. Every day your company is creating and managing massive amounts of business documents, contracts, proposals, sales decks, marketing material, blog posts, HR guidelines, training manuals, onboarding material, etc.</p>
              <p>These documents are often scattered all over the place on your digital devices- you may have Word files, files stored in cloud apps like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, files stored on your desktop, email attachments, and so on.</p>
			  <p>What happens when you can’t find a file in the middle of a meeting? Or when your manager immediately needs that important document, but you cannot seem to remember where you stored it?</p>
			  <p>A document management system plays a huge role in making all the tasks related to the management of documentation easier, faster and efficient.</p>
