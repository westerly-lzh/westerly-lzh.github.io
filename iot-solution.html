                The Internet of Things(IoT) in oil and gas industry is the smart technology used to create a network of
                physical devices that can connect to the internet, and be monitored and controlled through the internet.
                These things(devices) collect data and pass data through a series of gateways, concentrators or other
                telemetry devices, then integrated with other systems to process/analyse and store data.

                Extracting fuels from the ground and transporting them to the refinery to the end-user is a complex
                and critical task. Drilling equipment, pipelines, transportation and logistics – there are too many
                points to monitor along the way, with each one being critical, and potentially dangerous.
                Irrespective of which part of the Oil and Gas value chain – Upstream, Midstream, or Downstream, every
                sector is eventually adopting the IoT in Oil and Gas.

          <h4>Leak detection</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Detecting leaks in the oil and gas pipelines is crucial to prevent losses and accidents in factories.
                Petroleum products being volatile substances can easily catch fire and explode. With flow and pressure
                metering solution of IoT leaks in pipelines can be detected in real-time. This solution can also be used
                to identify leakage of toxic and combustible gases along with asphyxiants such as methane that are
                generally found in such industrial setups. IoT real-time alert system can alarm operators about these
                leaks and help them to take necessary actions to prevent any hazardous conditions.
