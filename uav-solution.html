            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Oil & gas facilities – both on and off shore -- require frequent inspection and maintenance to ensure
                safety and avoid failure. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have certainly made their place within the
                industry. The technology has
                found novel uses in the oil and gas industry, with a innovative, consistently available aerial
                perspective of operations to support the following key aspects:

          <h4>Oil Pipe Inspection</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Oil pipelines and their relevant infrastructures are located onshore and offshore, meaning rugged
                terrains that vary between hot deserts to frozen zones and even marshlands. The total length of oil
                pipelines exceeds from hundreds to thousands of miles often dangerous to inspect by humans. However,
                according to the strict standards of the industry, these inspections need to be carried out frequently
                and in a timely manner in order to prevent horrific accidents from happening.
              </p>
              <p>
                UAVs are autonomous drones which are equipped with state of the art sensors(image,video,gas, thermal
                scanner and even radar) which can pick up the oil/gas leak or anomaly within seconds. When paired with a
                detection systems behind, these UAVs don’t even require human analysis to find the abnormal cases .
              </p>
              <p> UAVs can also runs other infrastructure routine inspections to ensure consistent operational integrity

          <h4>Emergency Response Activities</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>
                In the event of a natural disaster or an industrial accident, UAVs can afford a broad overhead
                perspective of developments occurring on the ground.
              </p>
              <p>
                Real-time images and video analytics delivered by drones can also assist in plotting the progress of oil
                spills or fires, which can help companies better manage emergency response activities and channel
                resources appropriately while guaranteeing workers’ safety and wellbeing.

          <h4>Security & Monitoring Patrol</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Safety is a significant concern in all aspects of the oil and gas sector, and UAVs enable companies to
                eliminate the risks related to employees going into restricted spaces or other unsafe locales.</p>
              <p>
                UAVs are able to deliver 360-degree views of subjects for the monitoring of field operations, keep an
                eye on the development of new facilities, and eliminate traditional patrol methods of oil refineries,
                chimneys, smokestacks, storage tanks, jetties, and other potentially hazardous environments.
